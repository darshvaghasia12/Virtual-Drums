This project use Open CV to create a virtual drum set. It uses color detection in a region of interest and plays the corresponding drum beat. The drums are shown in the video output and hitting the drums with a green object would make you able to virtually play it.

Do give a star if you like this project!

## Installation

Clone and navigate into the directory. Install the required packages in your environment by using pip.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Open the project folder after installing requirements and run:

```bash
python virtual_drums.py
```

You can use a green stick as your drumstick, I had a couple of green pens lying around.

## Tutorial 

I have written an [article](https://medium.com/@navendupottekkat/virtual-drum-set-using-opencv-ebcb1553c778) explaining how this works. Please check that out!
